I am a Software Engineer residing in Seattle, Washington. I spend my day time developing distributed Big Data systems at Amazon Inc. and evenings tinkering with my personal applied ML projects.

I am particularly interested in all things Technology, Engineering and Products and write about these topics. Check out the Blog page, for latest articles.

## Work 

I currently work at the World Wide Operations Finance org at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. I have previously worked as a Software Engineer at Walmart Labs, Samsung Research and Myntra. I also write on different Medium publications like Mindorks, Towards Data Science and HackerNoon.

## Personal

When I am not coding or designing applications, I spend my time either on Twitter reading about latest startups or watching crime shows / anime on Netflix. Recently graduated from Arizona State University (Go devils!). Always ready to pet a dog
